Fibonacci — recursive

Stage 2
Problem: Implement the Fibonacci sequence recursively. F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0)=0, F(1)=1.

Input: one non-negative integer n (index)
Output: one integer — F(n)
Example: 7 → 13 (sequence: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13)
Time: O(2^n) naive recursion; O(n) with memoization
Space: O(n) recursion stack
